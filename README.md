# Clustering

**K-Means Clustering**

- Assume K = 3 (# of clusters)

- Find centroid for each partition

- Find distance between all data points to all cluster centroids.

- Move/Reassign datapoints to the nearest centroids.

- As the data has now changed so Recompute the centroids.

- Repeat step 3 - 5.

- Continue till we dont have to move any datapoint closer to any other centroid.
